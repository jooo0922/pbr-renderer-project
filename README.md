# PBR Renderer Project

## Overview

This project is a Physically Based Rendering (PBR) engine built from scratch, with inspiration drawn from the [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) tutorial series. The goal is to create a real-time rendering engine that produces realistic lighting and material effects by simulating the physical properties of surfaces and light.
